# Flight-Fare-Prediction

Welcome to the Flight Fare Prediction project repository! In this project, we aim to predict the fare of airline tickets based on various factors such as flight duration, days left for departure, arrival time, departure time, and more. We leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to build predictive models that can effectively estimate the price of airline tickets.

### Project Overview
Airline ticket pricing has become increasingly complex due to factors such as demand fluctuations, route popularity, and seasonal trends. To address this complexity, we utilize advanced ML algorithms to analyze historical data and predict future ticket prices accurately.

### Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains information about airline tickets, including:
<ul>
  <li>Airline: The name of the airline company.</li>
  <li>Date_of_Journey: The date of the journey.</li>
  <li>Source: The origin airport.</li>
  <li>Destination: The destination airport.</li>
  <li>Route: The flight route.</li>
  <li>Dep_Time: The departure time.</li>
  <li>Arrival_Time: The arrival time.</li>
  <li>Duration: The duration of the flight.</li>
  <li>Total_Stops: The total number of stops during the journey.</li>
  <li>Additional_Info: Additional information about the flight.</li>
  <li>Price: The price of the airline ticket.</li>
</ul>

### Steps Followed

In this project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis and preprocessing of the dataset to prepare it for model training and prediction. Here's a detailed explanation of the steps taken:

<ul>
  <li>Data Type Check and Conversion: I checked the data types of each column and adjusted them as needed for consistency.</li>
  <li>Handling Missing Values: Identified and dropped the small number of missing values in the dataset to maintain data integrity.</li>
  <li>Feature Engineering: Transformed continuous columns like 'Date_of_Journey' and 'Dep_Time' to extract useful information, such as splitting dates into day and month, and breaking down time into hours and minutes.</li>
  <li>Categorical Data Handling: Processed categorical variables using one-hot encoding and label encoding techniques to convert them into numerical format suitable for analysis.</li>
  <li>Outlier Handling: Detected and treated outliers to prevent them from skewing model predictions, ensuring robustness and reliability.</li>
  <li>Feature Selection: Identified the most influential features using correlation analysis and Random Forest model, focusing on those with the highest predictive power for improved model efficiency and performance.</li>
</ul>

### Models Trained
We train several models to predict flight fares, including:
<ul>
  <li>Linear Regression</li>
  <li>Random Forest Regressor</li>
  <li>XGBoost Regressor</li>
</ul>

### How to Use
To use the predictive model:
<ul>
  <li>Clone this repository to your local machine.</li>
  <li>Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.</li>
  <li>Run the provided scripts to preprocess the data and train the model.</li>
  <li>Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict flight fares by providing relevant input data.</li>
</ul>

### Conclusion
Flight Fare Prediction is a challenging yet rewarding task that can greatly benefit travelers and airline companies alike. By leveraging AI and ML techniques, we can make accurate predictions about future ticket prices, allowing travelers to plan their trips more effectively and airlines to optimize their pricing strategies.
